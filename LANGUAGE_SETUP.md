## üöÄ Installation Instructions

### For macOS Development Environment

Run the provided installation script:

```bash
./install-languages-macos.sh
```

This script automatically installs:
- **Homebrew** (if not present)
- **Node.js** (JavaScript runtime)
- **Python 3**
- **Go**
- **Rust**
- **Java** (OpenJDK 17)
- **Scala**
- **Kotlin**
- **Ruby** (updated version)
- **Swift** (via Xcode Command Line Tools)
- **C/C++** compilers (via Xcode Command Line Tools)

### For Production/Docker Environment

Use the comprehensive Docker setup:

```bash
# Build with all languages
docker build -f Dockerfile.full-languages -t ceesarcode-full .

# Or use Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.full-languages.yml up
```

### JavaScript Development

JavaScript is fully supported through Node.js runtime - no additional setup required!

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

Based on float-mean problem testing:

| Language | Compilation Time | Execution Time | Total Time |
|----------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| Python | 0ms | 22ms | 22ms |
| JavaScript | 0ms | 28ms | 28ms |
| Ruby | 0ms | 68ms | 68ms |
| Swift | 0ms | 177ms | 177ms |
| Go | ~200ms | 44ms | 244ms |
| Rust | ~200ms | 47ms | 247ms |
| C++ | ~300ms | 57ms | 357ms |
| Java | ~300ms | 66ms | 366ms |
| Kotlin | ~1800ms | 158ms | 1958ms |
| Scala | ~27000ms | 569ms | 27569ms |

## üõ†Ô∏è Language-Specific Notes

### Python
- Uses `python3` command
- Direct execution, no compilation
- Excellent performance

### C++/C
- Uses `g++`/`gcc` for compilation
- Creates executable binary
- Good performance after compilation

### Java
- Compiles with `javac` to `.class` files
- Runs with `java` command
- Moderate compilation time

### Kotlin
- Compiles with `kotlinc` to JAR file
- Requires Java runtime
- Slower compilation but good execution

### Scala
- Uses Scala 3 with `scala run` command
- Very slow compilation (27+ seconds)
- Good execution performance once compiled

### Go
- Uses `go run` for direct execution
- Fast compilation and execution
- Excellent overall performance

### Rust
- Compiles with `rustc` to binary
- Fast execution after compilation
- Good performance profile

### Swift
- Direct execution with `swift` command
- Good performance
- Note: Avoid Foundation imports for compatibility

### JavaScript/Node.js
- Direct execution with `node`
- Excellent performance
- No compilation needed

### Ruby
- Direct execution with `ruby`
- Good performance for scripting

### JavaScript (Recommended over TypeScript)
- Direct execution with Node.js
- No compilation needed
- Excellent performance and simplicity

### Bash/Shell
- Direct execution with proper permissions
- Instant startup
- Perfect for shell scripting problems

### SQL
- Built-in query validation
- Supports SELECT queries
- Instant validation

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Command not found" errors**
   - Run `./install-languages-macos.sh` to install missing languages
   - Restart terminal after installation

2. **JavaScript development**
   - Use JavaScript instead of TypeScript for simplicity
   - Full Node.js runtime support available

3. **Scala slow performance**
   - Normal behavior due to JVM startup and compilation
   - Consider using simpler languages for time-critical problems

4. **Swift Foundation errors**
   - Avoid `import Foundation` for compatibility
   - Use basic Swift syntax without external frameworks

### Verification Commands

Check if all languages are properly installed:

```bash
python3 --version
node --version
# TypeScript removed
go version
rustc --version
javac -version
scalac -version
kotlinc -version
ruby --version
swift --version
gcc --version
```

## üéØ Production Deployment

### Docker Setup

The `Dockerfile.full-languages` includes:

- **Ubuntu 22.04** base image
- **All 14 programming languages** pre-installed
- **Optimized compilation settings**
- **Health checks** for service monitoring
- **Multi-stage build** for efficiency

### Environment Variables

- `EXECUTOR_MODE=docker` for containerized execution
- Proper PATH configuration for all language runtimes
- Temporary directory mounting for submissions

## üìà Usage Statistics

After full installation, users can:

- ‚úÖ **Submit code in any of 14 languages** without additional setup
- ‚úÖ **Switch languages seamlessly** with automatic stub loading
- ‚úÖ **Create problems** that support multiple languages
- ‚úÖ **Deploy in production** with full language support

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Deploy Docker image** for production environments
2. **Set up CI/CD** with language verification tests
3. **Monitor performance** and optimize slow languages
4. **Add more languages** as needed (PHP, Perl, etc.)
