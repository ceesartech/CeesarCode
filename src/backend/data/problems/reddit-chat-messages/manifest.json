  "Statement": "The core task of this problem is to implement the function:\n\nmerge_messages(ids [])\nThe specific requirements are as follows:\n\nRetrieve chat messages: Given a list of chat message IDs (already provided), each ID can be used to fetch its surrounding messages (5 before and 5 after, including itself) using the provided function:\nget_chat_messages(id)\nMerge results: Combine all messages retrieved from the given IDs into a single collection.\nDeduplication: If multiple IDs retrieve overlapping messages, duplicates must be removed.\nSorting: The final returned messages should be sorted by ID.\nThe problem explicitly states that you cannot simply use a Set for deduplication and sorting. Instead, you need to think of alternative ways to accomplish the task.\n",
