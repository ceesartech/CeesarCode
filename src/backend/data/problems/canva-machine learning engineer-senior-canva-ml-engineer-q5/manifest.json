  "title": "Handling Data Skew in Search Ranking Models",
  "statement": "Canva's search ranking models are trained on user search queries and clicks.  The data is often skewed, with a long tail of less frequent queries and a small number of popular queries. Explain how you would address data skew in this scenario to improve the performance of the search ranking models, especially for the less frequent queries. Discuss techniques such as re-sampling, cost-sensitive learning, and transfer learning. Propose a specific strategy for dealing with the skew in the training data and evaluate its potential impact on model performance, particularly on the less frequent queries.  How would you measure the effectiveness of your solution, and what metrics would you use? Assume you are using a standard Learning-to-Rank framework with features like query-template relevance scores, template popularity, and user personalization signals.\n\nExample Input: A dataset of search queries, template IDs, and click labels (1 for click, 0 for no click).\n\nExpected Output: A detailed explanation of your strategy for handling data skew, including specific techniques, evaluation metrics, and a discussion of potential trade-offs.",
