  "title": "Data Pipeline Design for Real-time Object Detection in Image Uploads",
  "statement": "Canva is building a feature to automatically tag objects in user-uploaded images to improve searchability and content organization. Design a robust and scalable data pipeline to perform real-time object detection on these images. The pipeline should handle a high volume of image uploads, perform inference efficiently, and store the detected objects and their bounding boxes in a database for querying.  Describe the different stages of the pipeline (e.g., image ingestion, pre-processing, model inference, post-processing, data storage), the technologies you would use (e.g., Kafka, TensorFlow Serving, Redis, PostgreSQL), and how you would ensure fault tolerance and scalability. How would you monitor the performance of the pipeline and detect anomalies? What considerations would you take into account to deal with constantly evolving object detection models? \n\nExample Input: A stream of image files uploaded by users.\n\nExpected Output: A detailed architecture diagram and explanation of the data pipeline, including technology choices, scalability considerations, and monitoring strategies.",
